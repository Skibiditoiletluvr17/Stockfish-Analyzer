# Stockfish-Analyzer
Source code for my chess GUI with Stockfish analysis
To run this code:
1. Download the Stockfish engine
2. Open the command prompt and change directory (cd) to the Python file location
3. run "python StockfishGUI.py /path/to/stockfish" <-- Insert path to stockfish engine
4. I have only run this on Windows, and I'm not sure if it runs on other platforms
